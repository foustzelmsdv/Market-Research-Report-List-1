<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Refrigerated Dryers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intermittent Type</li><li>Continuous Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The refrigerated dryers market consists of two main types: intermittent and continuous. Intermittent type dryers operate in cycles, turning on and off based on demand, making them suitable for applications with variable compressed air needs. In contrast, continuous type dryers maintain a constant output, providing a steady flow of dry air, ideal for applications requiring consistent performance. Both types effectively reduce moisture from compressed air systems, enhancing equipment efficiency and preventing corrosion. The choice depends on operational requirements and air demand patterns.</p></p>
