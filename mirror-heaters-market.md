<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mirror Heaters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Infrared Type</li><li>Traditional Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mirror heaters come in two primary types: infrared and traditional. Infrared mirror heaters use radiant heat technology, warming objects directly rather than heating the air, which results in energy efficiency and instant warmth. Traditional mirror heaters, on the other hand, rely on convection heating, warming the air first before distributing heat throughout the room. Both systems are designed to enhance comfort and aesthetic appeal in bathrooms or living spaces, offering unique benefits depending on users' preferences and heating needs.</p></p>
