<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrophobic Intraocular Lens IOLs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Not Pre-loaded IOLs</li><li>Pre-loaded IOLs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Hydrophobic Intraocular Lens (IOL) market is divided into two main types: not pre-loaded IOLs and pre-loaded IOLs. Not pre-loaded IOLs require manual loading into an injector before implantation, allowing for greater flexibility in lens selection during surgery. In contrast, pre-loaded IOLs come ready-to-use in a sterile cartridge, facilitating quicker and more efficient procedures. Both types aim to enhance surgical precision and patient outcomes in cataract surgery, with varying benefits related to ease of use and operational efficiency.</p></p>
