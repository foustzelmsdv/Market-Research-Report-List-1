<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane Elastomers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic Elastomers</li><li>Thermosetting Elastomers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyurethane elastomers are categorized into two main types: thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) and thermosetting elastomers (TPUs). TPEs are versatile materials that can be processed like plastics while maintaining rubber-like properties, allowing for easy recycling and injection molding. In contrast, thermosetting elastomers become permanently hard when cured and exhibit high durability and resilience, making them suitable for applications requiring thermal stability and chemical resistance. Both types are widely used across diverse industries, including automotive, construction, and consumer goods.</p></p>
